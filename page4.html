                <p class="mbr-text align-center display-5 pb-3 mbr-fonts-style"><br>“How Important is Mental Health For You?”
<br>
<br>Therese: To avoid distractions and if experiencing depression like you can control yourself on how you can overcome what are you going through.
<br>
<br>Samuel: It’s very important because many people experienced depression and has the highest rate of suicidal attemps today and most of the reasons of it is depression and most often they’re lonely they feel like that of thingking.
<br>
<br>Jowen: mental health is more important than our physical health and of course because when it comes to mental, we couldn’t easily control and heal it so that’s why we should take good care of it and this is really important for us, to help us do whatever it is that we want with a healthy mental health. Always do what you want so that we can remember our loved ones and that’s why we need to take good care of our mental health.
<br>Jenina: How important it is, It’s relevant nowadays, because many people experienced it and some of them doesn’t, some of them don’t exposed what they’re thinking inside of them. Maybe partially because there’s shy and some are anxious when expressing there selves and that’s the stigma about it so its really  relevant to voice out when someones having a mental health issues because to speak within yourself and so that many people could express there selves comfortably.
<br>Dr. Josefina: This is very important to each people, practically because this talks about its sense of despositions. It talks about its ways of delinquent people in the atmost way possible or we called it “Pleasing” so that’s why its important with the person, its family, with its community when all of us are mentally healthy people we will get along with each other.
<br>
<br>Sir Arniel: its very important although I’m not not clinically diagnosed having depression but I know I have that kind of illness or disorder. 3 years ago until now I’m fighting for that kind of illness but I’m much better now. So for me its very important because you know the feeling that you can’t easily control it, it only arrives immediately even though you are happy then with just one click thoughts immediately came in and everything and you don’t know how are you going to erase it, you don’t even know what to say So to whom? And if you didn’t take care of it what will happen? That is why this leads to despair. Because this kind of illness or disorder they already feel hopeless because within me is like hell if there wasn’t any support from anyone or everything around you, everyone is around you. Nothings gonna happen that person is poor. I’m just very lucky because I have faith, I have friends and I have someone that one person I can tell how deep my thoughts are. Mental health is all about our brain and if we don’t have a brain what will happen to us?
<br>Mareiah: So mental health is very important for me because for me If I balanced my thoughts my mental health all I can say is I’m in sane like Insane that means I’m in a good condition because if your thinking bad it will reflect on your actions, It will reflect on your feelings and it will reflect on what are you going to say. We see disabilities because there mental health is not good though its not like they did not choose that there kind of thinking is like that but they were born with that situation unlike others they choose to be like that. so for me I will choose I will put myself to where I know my mental health is stable  I will be sane and because it will balance my health I know that my actions and decisions are right.
<br>
<br>“What Advices can you give for those who are going through mental struggles?”
<br>
<br>Therese: Gain positivity like that and what things that makes you happy do it because it decreases stress and avoid negativity.
<br>
<br>Samuel: First be open to the people surrounding them, to there parents because they are there to help them. Feel free to open up your problems second open up your problems to your friends because it helps a lot because if they keep containing it the problems would overflow there brains and it would cause them to breakdown, which might lead to suicide.
<br>
<br>Jowen: Don’t lose hope, just think of what your dream is, think of what will be your goals in life and stay true to yourself.
<br>
<br>Jenina: Don’t be afraid to speak out. Because you can’t blame other people like they’re reaching out for you they can’t open you up because they’re maybe shy and don’t be afraid of what people thinks of you and take that courage.
<br>Dr. Josefina: Frustrations are normal, stresses are normal. A person should be able to recognize when this occurs and should be able to seek the best help. First, from themselves that’s “self-help”. Second, to God we need to seek God’s help. Third, to other people who would be able to help them and understand them.
<br>
<br>Sir Arniel: Each one of us has a best friend or family. First, we or you have to admitted that you have that kind of condition because if you were in a denial stage, although I’m in a denial stage its hard if you admit it the doors and the windows will slowly open that’s the opportunity for you to escape from your struggles but is a long process. In that long process always find the good things in everything there will be anxiety, don’t push yourself to the limits. If you have that kind of struggle keep a distance from your worries it will trigger and it will cause that kind feeling to you and if you open up yourself, open it to your family because its really important me as I study human behaviorism about society and everything and if you have special someone of course it can understand you. Be open minded, open for all the possibilities and always think there’s someone for you of course God is there he will use people for you to feel that your not alone because that’s the hardest feeling of a person that he/she is alone and that’s when despair enters that the person will suffer.
<br>Mareiah: for me what I can say is we can’t do nothing if he/she is not with God. “I do all things with Christ” like I said balancing my mental health I can’t do that on my own because it needs Gods help. For me we need to be humble and surrender it all to God
<br>All of our struggles for our mental health .
